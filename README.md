# iOS Location Tracking App

## Overview

This iOS app tracks the user's location and adds markers on the map every time the location changes by 100 meters. The app continues location tracking in the foreground and background for as long as possible. The markers display the address of the location and allow users to start or stop the tracking. The route is resettable, and previous routes are displayed when the app is reopened.
